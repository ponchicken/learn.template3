        Say, “Yes, I am here,” to a lonely shelter kitty or puppy. We can all
        use a little scratch behind the ears. Donate your time to help the
        animals! Opportunities include dog walking, puppy and kitty petting,
        yard sale assistance, fundraising, community outreach, and more. Your
        valuable gift of time will have a positive impact on our community.

        All of our volunteers are wonderful people just like you. As an advocate
        for animal welfare you will have many two legged and four legged
        friends! Say, “Yes, I am here,” and volunteer today.
